• Red (Really not good)
• Orange (Not good)
• Yellow (Neutral)
• Green (Good)
• Blue (Very good)

### Summary Screen
Visual display of all the results, anonymous

### Teacher/Admin screen
Will the teacher be able to see how each student responded? They would not who is doing not well...
Ability to see week or month view to see how students feel over time

## Backend
• Database for each student to have unique ID
  • email, user id?
• Capture date and feeling for each student
